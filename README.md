## FileHasher
FileHasher is a simple Java library (with Maven pom.xml project configuration) that I've written, that can be used to generate 
a cryptographic hash value on a single file or all files (recursively, through subdirectories) in a directory.

It is fairly simple, and is a demonstration of my Java skills for a career portfolio. 

I am planning to add JavaDocs integration, and I could possibly add JDBC functionality where you stream-in files to a 
JDBC Driver Connector, a specific algorithm, and a designation hash-storing table.

You could also implement similar functionality by converting network files (in RAM) to FileInputStreams.

I'm busy with classes right now though so this will have to wait.
